##########################
 Multiple Dataset Support
##########################

Since `anemoi-training=0.4`, The framework supports training with multiple datasets
simultaneously. This enables use cases such as downscaling, or leveraging diverse
data sources to improve model generalisation.

**********
 Overview
**********

When multiple datasets are configured:

#. Each dataset has its own encoder and decoder, allowing dataset-specific input and output representations.

#. Encoded representations from all datasets are combined in a shared latent space.

#. A single shared processor operates on the combined latent representation.

.. warning::
    All datasets must share the same time resolution and forecast horizon or interpolation target times.


Dataset-Specific Configuration
------------------------------

Any training component that must be configured per dataset (e.g. normalisation, dataset-specific options) is now defined under a dataset-specific configuration block. This makes it possible to mix datasets with different preprocessing requirements while still benefiting from shared representation learning.
Similarly, dataset-specific encoders and decoders can handle differing input/output variable sets.

    :scale: 50%


Example Use Cases
-----------------

The multi-dataset setup can be used for various use cases, by combining different combinations of forcing and diagnostic variables across datasets.

For example, downscaling can be achieved by using a high-resolution dataset where all variables to be downscaled are set to be diagnostics, and a lower-resolution dataset where all variables are set to be forcings.

Similarly, a multi-dataset variant of a limited area model can be created as follows:

*********************************
 Configuration Structure Changes
*********************************

To support per-dataset configuration, the YAML structure has changed for several config entries. The configuration now supports a dictionary-based approach ("dict-ification") for datasets and related components. The entry point is a `datasets:` field, which is a dictionary where each key is a dataset name and the value is its configuration.

For example, a configuration that previously looked like this:

.. code:: yaml

    processors:
        normaliser:
            default: mean-std


now becomes:

.. code:: yaml

    datasets:
        your_dataset_name:
            processors:
                normaliser:
                    default: mean-std


Each dataset is identified by a unique name, and all configuration that applies specifically to that dataset is defined within its block.


*********************************************
 Dataloader Dataset Reader Configuration
*********************************************

The dataloader dataset reader structure has been updated to use a dedicated
``dataset_config`` key. This is a breaking change intended to remove ambiguous
nesting and make the mapping to ``open_dataset`` explicit.

The required structure is:

.. code:: yaml

    dataloader:
        training:
            datasets:
                era5:
                    dataset_config:
                        dataset: ${system.input.dataset}
                        frequency: ${data.frequency}
                        drop: []
                        select: []
                        statistics: /path/to/statistics.zarr
                    start: 1985
                    end: 2020
                    trajectory: null

where ``dataset_config`` is passed to ``open_dataset`` as a dictionary, i.e.:

.. code:: python

    open_dataset({"dataset": ..., "frequency": ..., "drop": ..., "select": ..., "statistics": ...})


Previous format (no longer supported in validated configurations):

.. code:: yaml

    dataloader:
        training:
            datasets:
                era5:
                    dataset:
                        name: ${system.input.dataset}
                        frequency: ${data.frequency}
                        drop: []
                    start: 1985
                    end: 2020
                    trajectory: null


*****************
 Graph Creation
*****************

The graph must define a set of nodes for each dataset. The dataset name has to be used as the nodes name in the graph
recipe.


***************************************
 Dataset Name Conventions in Templates
***************************************

In the configuration templates provided with the framework, we use "data" as a generic placeholder for the dataset name. For example:

.. code:: yaml

    datasets:
        data:
            normaliser:
                default: mean-std


The key under datasets can be any user-defined name and serves only as an identifier for that dataset within the configuration. When adapting a template, you may rename "data" to something more descriptive (e.g. `era5`, or `cerra`), or define multiple dataset entries as needed.

All dataset-specific configuration must be nested under the corresponding dataset name.

*************************************
 Example Multi-Dataset Configuration
*************************************

Here is an example configuration snippet for two datasets, `era5` and `cerra`:

.. code:: yaml

    data:
        datasets:
            era5:
                forcing:
                - "cos_latitude"
                - "cos_longitude"
                - "sin_latitude"
                - "sin_longitude"
                - "cos_julian_day"
                - "cos_local_time"
                - "sin_julian_day"
                - "sin_local_time"
                - "insolation"
                - "lsm"
                - "sdor"
                - "slor"
                - "z"
                diagnostic: [tp, cp]
                processors:
                    normalizer:
                        _target_: anemoi.models.preprocessing.normalizer.InputNormalizer
                        config:
                            default: "mean-std"
                            std:
                            - "tp"
                            min-max:
                            max:
                            - "sdor"
                            - "slor"
                            - "z"
                            none:
                            - "cos_latitude"
                            - "cos_longitude"
                            - "sin_latitude"
                            - "sin_longitude"
                            - "cos_julian_day"
                            - "cos_local_time"
                            - "sin_julian_day"
                            - "sin_local_time"
                            - "insolation"
                            - "lsm"

            cerra:
                forcing:
                - "cos_latitude"
                - "cos_longitude"
                - "sin_latitude"
                - "sin_longitude"
                - "cos_julian_day"
                - "cos_local_time"
                - "sin_julian_day"
                - "sin_local_time"
                diagnostic: [tp]
                processors:
                    normalizer:
                        _target_: anemoi.models.preprocessing.normalizer.InputNormalizer
                        config:
                            default: "mean-std"
                            std:
                            - "tp"
                            min-max:
                            max:
                            none:
                            - "cos_latitude"
                            - "cos_longitude"
                            - "sin_latitude"
                            - "sin_longitude"
                            - "cos_julian_day"
                            - "cos_local_time"
                            - "sin_julian_day"
                            - "sin_local_time"

Since they have different variables, each dataset has its own lists of forcing and diagnostic variables, as well as its own normaliser configuration.

*****************
 Migration Notes
*****************

#. If you are using a single dataset, you still need to define it under the datasets key when using the new layout.

#. Existing configuration values generally remain the same, but their location in the YAML file has changed.

#. All configuration snippets throughout the documentation have been updated to reflect the new structure.

#. For dataloader dataset readers, use ``dataset_config`` (outer key) and ``dataset`` (inner key). The old ``dataset``/``name`` shape is deprecated and should be migrated.

#. We strongly recommend updating configurations to the new datasets-based layout, as this is the forward-compatible and fully supported format.
