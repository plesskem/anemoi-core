 Diagnostics
#############

The diagnostics module in anemoi-training is used to monitor progress
during training. It is split into two parts:

   #. tracking training to a standard machine learning tracking tool.
      This monitors the training and validation losses and uploads the
      plots created by the callbacks.

   #. a series of callbacks, evaluated on the validation dataset,
      including plots of example forecasts and power spectra plots;

**Trackers**

By default, anemoi-training uses MLFlow tracker, but it includes
functionality to use both Weights & Biases and Tensorboard.

**Callbacks**

The callbacks can also be used to evaluate forecasts over longer
rollouts beyond the forecast time that the model is trained on. The
number of rollout steps for verification (or forecast iteration steps)
is set using ``config.dataloader.validation_rollout =
*num_of_rollout_steps*``.

Callbacks are configured in the config file under the
``config.diagnostics`` key.

For regular callbacks, they can be provided as a list of dictionaries
underneath the ``config.diagnostics.callbacks`` key. Each dictionary
must have a ``_target_`` key which is used by hydra to instantiate the
callback, any other kwarg is passed to the callback's constructor.

.. code:: yaml

   callbacks:
      - _target_: anemoi.training.diagnostics.callbacks.evaluation.RolloutEval
      rollout: ${dataloader.validation_rollout}
      frequency: 20

Plotting callbacks are configured in a similar way, but they are
specified underneath the ``config.diagnostics.plot.callbacks`` key.
This is done to ensure seperation and ease of configuration between
experiments.
``config.diagnostics.plot`` is a broader config file specifying the
parameters to plot, as well as the plotting frequency, and
asynchronosity.

Setting ``config.diagnostics.plot.asynchronous``, means that the model
training doesn't stop whilst the callbacks are being evaluated. This is
useful for large models where the plotting can take a long time. The
plotting module uses asynchronous callbacks via `asyncio` and
`concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` to handle plotting tasks without
blocking the main application. A dedicated event loop runs in a separate
background thread, allowing plotting tasks to be offloaded to worker
threads. This setup keeps the main thread responsive, handling
plot-related tasks asynchronously and efficiently in the background.

Plot adapter compatibility
==========================

Task-specific plot adapters normalize output handling so plotting
callbacks can use the same interface across task types:

- forecaster tasks use ``ForecasterPlotAdapter``;
- diffusion tasks use ``DiffusionPlotAdapter``;
- autoencoder tasks use ``AutoencoderPlotAdapter``;
- multi-output interpolation uses
  ``InterpolatorMultiOutPlotAdapter``.

These adapters rely on the shared task ``_step`` return format
``(loss, metrics, predictions)`` where ``predictions`` is always a list
of dataset-keyed dictionaries.

**Focus Area**

Plotting callbacks (such as ``PlotSample``, ``PlotLoss``, and ``LongRolloutPlots``) support a ``focus_area`` parameter. This allows you to restrict the geographic scope of plots to specific regions or masks. A focus area can be defined in two ways:

* **Mask Name**: A ``mask_attr_name`` string referencing a boolean mask defined within the graph data.
* **Lat/Lon Bounds**: A ``latlon_bbox`` list specifying a bounding box: ``[lat_min, lon_min, lat_max, lon_max]``.

When a focus area is applied, the plot filenames and experiment log tags will automatically include a suffix (e.g., ``_mask_attr_name`` or ``_latlon_bbox``) to distinguish them from global plots.

.. code:: yaml

   # Example: Focusing on multiple specific geographic region
   focus_areas:
      europe:
         latlon_bbox: [30.0, -20.0, 60.0, 40.0]
      china:
         latlon_bbox: [18.0, 73.0, 54.0, 135.0]

**Rendering Methods**

There is an additional flag in the plotting callbacks to control the
rendering method for geospatial plots, offering a trade-off between
performance and detail.

* When `datashader` is set to True, Datashader is
   used for rendering, which accelerates plotting through efficient
   hexbining, particularly useful for large datasets. This approach can
   produce smoother-looking plots due to the aggregation of data points.
* If `datashader` is set to False, matplotlib.scatter is used, which provides
   sharper and more detailed visuals but may be slower for large datasets.

**Projection**

Plotting callbacks also support ``config.diagnostics.plot.projection_kind``
to control the map projection used for geospatial figures.

- ``equirectangular`` (default): regular axes, no Cartopy dependency.
- ``lambert_conformal``: regional Lambert Conformal projection fitted to
  the plotted latitude/longitude domain (requires Cartopy).

When ``datashader: True`` is enabled, plotting is forced to
``equirectangular`` because Datashader rendering does not support
Cartopy transforms.

**Note** - this asynchronous behaviour is only available for the
plotting callbacks.

**Progress Bar**

The progress bar callback can be configured to control how training
progress is displayed. This is particularly useful on HPC systems with
SLURM where output is written to files, as the default RichProgressBar
in PyTorch Lightning 2.6+ may not work correctly. The progress bar is controlled by two configuration options:

-  ``enable_progress_bar``: A boolean flag to enable or disable the
   progress bar entirely
-  ``progress_bar``: Configuration for which progress bar callback to
   use

.. code:: yaml

   enable_progress_bar: True
   progress_bar:
     _target_: pytorch_lightning.callbacks.TQDMProgressBar
     refresh_rate: 1

Lightning 2.6+ supports the
(https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/api/lightning.pytorch.callbacks.RichProgressBar.html#lightning.pytorch.callbacks.RichProgressBar)[RichProgressBar],
which is recommended for interactive terminals and
(https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/api/lightning.pytorch.callbacks.TQDMProgressBar.html#lightning.pytorch.callbacks.TQDMProgressBar)[TQDMProgressBar]
, that should be used with SLURM.
